# Tweaker

Flutter project for managing the kernel without root. This application can be used with the Rave patch included in the kernel.
The custom patch implements a new custom syscall used with this application via a dynamic C library (to directly call kernel code).
The project is currently tested on the Xiaomi Pad 5 (nabu) using my kernel (Rave).
Therefore, this project is only compiled for Android arm64.

## Disclaimer

This project is currently a work in progress. Feel free to submit pull requests or report issues.

## How to build

Just refer to the Flutter documentation. Have fun.
